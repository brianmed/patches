# Patches.pl

    Hopefully a straightforward patch management system.

    The web interface is used to display the system's patch level, and the
    ability to Update or Reboot a box.

### Installation

    1. Web interface

        - $ perl Patches.pl daemon

### Caveats

    1. CentOS centric; will glady update (with help) for other distributions,
       and hopefully BSD and Windows (maybe?).

    2. Must have 'sudo' rights.
